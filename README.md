# Overview

This software's purpose was to practice using GIS mapping libraries with HTML and JavaScript. 

This map software uses ArcGIS services and maps by ESRI to show a map. A button is provided to mark the device's current location from an HTML location query, and this is placed as a point on the map with a timestamp of when it was made.

# Future Work

* Be able to import plot points to add more points.
* Be able to remove plot points.
* Save the plot points between runs.
* Search for plot points by timestamp.
